## Repo for barely functioning code
rpg.py is the one which renders the background with it's own code.
rog.py uses a map.
Comparison:

**rpg.py**:
- has working collision (bit janky tho)

**rog.py**:
- implements food
**both**:
- enemies spawn and follow the player
- it scrollssssss

**Note: The file paths assume that this directory is located at /rpg. Please move this directory to that location or modify the file paths in local testing.**
